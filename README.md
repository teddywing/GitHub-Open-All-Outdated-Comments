GitHub Open All Outdated Comments
=================================

A [Greasemonkey][1] user script that expands all hidden pull request comments.
Normally on GitHub’s pull request page, changes to a line cause line comments to
collapse. Any replies added to a conversation are hidden from view. This script
makes it easier to see all replies by expanding everything by default.


## Install
Ensure Greasemonkey is installed and activated. Open the [raw script][2] and
click “Install” in the resulting dialog. A [more detailed explanation][3] is
available on the Greasemonkey wiki.
